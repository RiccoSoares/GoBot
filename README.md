# GoBot
An implementation of a Deep Learning Go Bot (game of Go), based on Deep Learning and the Game of Go, by Max Pumperla and Kevin Ferguson (https://github.com/maxpumperla/deep_learning_and_the_game_of_go)

The current strongest bot was implemented using Pytorch framework. He's available in 9x9 and 19x19 board versions and both are CNN-based, using training data generated by Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm (also implemented). Current implementation corresponds to the book's chapter 6.
